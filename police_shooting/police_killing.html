        <h1>Police Killings in the United States in 2015</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the country that is famous for personal liberty and individualism, a virus is spreading. 
            The virus does not have a concrete shape or form, and it infects people inconspicuously by 
            creating fears and letting the blood spill with cold eyes. Some people call it the dedicated agent of <em>the New Jim Crow</em>,
            and some, who refuse to stay silent, have relentlessly acted against it with courage. 
            The virus has a common name of police killing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In year 2015 alone, more than <b>1500</b> people lost their lives on the hands of police officers.
            The Washington Post collected information about these 1500 people and incidents that led to their death
            and conducted a series of data journalism works. For research purpose, I have scraped the 
            <a href="https://github.com/tiffanyfrance/CAPP30239_FA22/blob/main/week_06/a3cleanedonly2015.json">data</a> 
            from the website, which I have replicated some of the graphs with the goal of rethinking what happened 
            in that year and what implications we can get from the loss.
        </p>
        <h2>xx Month has the highest count of police killings</h2>
            <div id = "month"></div>
            <div class="month_narrative">
                <p><b>Narrative</b> Over the course of 2015, </p>
                <p><b>Why line chart?</b>: A line chart is a solid choice to display information that is time related.
                </p>
                <p><b>Data points:</b> Date</p> <p><b>Supplementary information:</b> how to build interactions?</p>
            </div>
        <h2>African Americans are overrepresented in police killing victims</h2> 
            <div class = "float-container">
                <div class="float-child race" id="race"></div>
                <div class="float-child race_narrative">
                    <p><b>Narrative:</b> In year 2015, 378 out of 1537 victims murdered by police officers in the US were Blacks. This group,
                        however, only represented 13ish % of the nation's population. Comparatively, half of the victims were
                        Whites, the racial group that accounted for over 70% of the population. Police officers disproportionately 
                        killed racial minorities (with the exception of Asian), but why?
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Why vertical bar chart?</b>: A bar chart is a solid choice to display information about groups.
                        For this plot, I have one single mission in mind when creating it: showing the number of police
                        killings by race. This make a horizontal/vertical bar chart appropriate (not the former because
                        the number of categories is few). 
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Data points:</b> variable Race </p> <p><b>Supplementary information:</b> adding sex/state would be great</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        <h2>Officers in xxx state killed the most people with mental disabilities</h2>

        <div id="state_plus_mental_stacked"></div>
            <p><b>Narrative:</b> In 2015, around xxx percent of people murdered by police officers in the state of xxx had some degrees
            of mental disabilities. </p>
            <p><b>Why stacked bar chart?</b>: To show proportion of different categories (mental disabilities) by another categorical variable (in this case, state).
            As for this plot, a divergent bar chart wpi;dalso makes sense</p>
            <p><b>Data points:</b> state, mental_illness</p> <p><b>Supplementary information:</b> how to build interactions?</p>
