            In criminal procedure, arrest represents a serious invasion of individual liberty. The Fourth Amendment requires that for an officers to arrest someone, a
            probable cause that a crime is committed, was committed or will be committed by the person to be arrested must be provided. This is also the idea of
            reasonableness, which is the cornerstone of the Fourth Amendment.
