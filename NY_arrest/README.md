# New York Violent Crime Arrests in 2021

## Project Information
The repository contains codes and data used for my class final project, which is a data storytelling report of New York violent crime arrests in 2021. Violent crime arrests refer to police arrests of people who committed one or more types of violent crimes - murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. The idea originated from my early year's interections with ex-offenders in Minnesota during which I firsthand saw how police arrests and jail detentions could impact people. After doing some research, I noticed that very little study scoped on on violent crime arrests, which fostered my interest in studying this topic to fill this gap.  

The completed data journalism project can be viewed at https://jcvincentliu.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/NY_arrest/arrest.html. 

## Data

I used the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) - National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) arrest and census data as my main data sources. UCR is one of the two primary crime data measures in the nation, along with NCVS (National Crime Victimization Survey). I chose NIBRS because it contains comprehensive police arrests information across the nation, aggregated by incidents. The census data is used to estimate violent crime arrest rates by states.

## Appreciation

I want to thank my professor Tiffany France for her support and help throughout this quarter. I learned a lot from her expertise and patience. I wouldn't be able to finish this project without her instructions for which I am truly grateful.
